# Portfolio-Website

This project is a personal portfolio website built using HTML and CSS. It showcases my profile, skills, projects, and GitHub link in a clean, responsive layout. The site is based on a provided template structure, but it has been customized and personalized with my own content, styling, media, and animations.
